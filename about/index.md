Hi, I'm a front-end web developer, but since I'm also an ~~arch user, btw~~ open source enthusiast and generally a tech-savvy person, I tend to be more of a generalist. Still, since web-frontend is my main job at the moment, I prefer to use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), and for this reason, [i'm worried about it's future](/blog/on-vue-3).
