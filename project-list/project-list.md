Here's the list of open-source projects i've developed:

1. Personal-page
    
    Yep, this very page you're currently visiting. This site is totally usable with noscript, and that's on purpose. Please, try to keep it the way it is. Still, it have some quality of life features for those with javascript enabled.
2. [Hehex-color-picker](https://github.com/Pacifist-Penguin/Hehex-color-picker)

    [DEMO](https://github.com/Pacifist-Penguin/Hehex-color-picker)
    Tool to get hex colors with regex and edit given colors by shifting HSL.
    I used it to create my own [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) themes: [Diry-orange](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/Dirty-orange-blender-theme), [Dark-violet](https://github.com/NewPirateOfUASeas/Dark-violet-blender-theme). Don't get me wrong, most likely you won't be able to build a perfect theme with just this tool, but imho it's a good starting point.
3. [Stop-screencast](https://github.com/Pacifist-Penguin/stop-screencast)

    [DEMO](https://pacifist-penguin.github.io/stop-screencast/)
    Just a prototype. This app (or I would say a component) is inspired by the khan academy component used in the JS course.
4. [Backgammon-vue](https://github.com/Pacifist-Penguin/backgammon-vue)

    [DEMO](https://github.com/Pacifist-Penguin/stop-screencast)
    Backgammon game (short version). I made this only to practice with Vue.
5. [EZ-font-styling-with-css-n-vue](https://github.com/Pacifist-Penguin/ez-font-styling-with-css-n-vue)

    [DEMO](https://pacifist-penguin.github.io/stop-screencast/)
    Tool to configure font styles.
