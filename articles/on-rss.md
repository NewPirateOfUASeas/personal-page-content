# On RSS

RSS saves me so much time! I no longer spend time looking at recommendations on YouTube, etc., but only follow the people I really care about. Well, that's why i decided to use [@nuxtjs/feed](https://github.com/nuxt-community/feed-module) in this project. 

By the way, I use [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org/). ![newsboat screenshot](https://newsboat.org/images/2.25-screenshot_1x-33f26153.png) The main reason i use TUI applications whenever it's possible, is because those app are keyboard-driven, which is much better for your wrist health
